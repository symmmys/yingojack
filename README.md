Yin Pitch Detection algorithm in Golang.

Read about the algorithm [here](http://audition.ens.fr/adc/pdf/2002_JASA_YIN.pdf).

The core implementation is ported from [here](https://github.com/ashokfernandez/Yin-Pitch-Tracking).

Check /examples for some simple usage.

Requires [JACK](https://github.com/xthexder/go-jack) for microphone analysis.
